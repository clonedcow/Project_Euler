The intuition for this problem is to notice that when a laserbeam reflects off a mirror,
it is the same as if the triangle were reflected across that line and the laser just continued straight.

Then, you can fill a trianglular grid where each coordinate is marked as A, B, or C.
Furthermore, you can skew the triangles so they're 45-45-90 triangles with A(0,1), B(1,1), C(0,0).
For each path, the laser is "reflected" when it hits a vertical axis, horizontal axis, or passes a line with slope 1.
